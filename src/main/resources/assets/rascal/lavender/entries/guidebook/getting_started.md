This is a collection of useful tips to help orient players. At any time, click the {red}Recipe Book{} in the inventory
to explore available items and recipes!


**__Zoom__**

Use <keybind;key.spyglass-improvements.use> with a {blue}Spyglass{} in your inventory to use it.


**__No Mob Griefing__**

Mobs will no longer grief your world!

;;;;;

Specifically, Endermen can no longer pick up blocks and creeper explosions will heal themselves back.

**__Companions__**

Pets will always follow their owner and won't get stuck in unloaded chunks. They'll also follow their owner through
portals and through **[Waystones](^rascal:waystones)**. They're also smarter, avoiding confrontation when they're low
on health and sticking near their owner.

;;;;;

**__Hunger__**

The hunger bar will now display {red}exhaustion{} as a grey background and {blue}saturation{} in as a yellow outline.


**__Mob Transport__**

When transporting mobs with a boat or minecart, they can be dismounted by pressing <keybind;key.sneak>+<keybind;key.use>
on the vehicle.

;;;;;

Allays can also be picked up in a {blue}Bottle{}, useful for long distance travel.


**__Trinkets__**

Trinkets are *accessory slots* that allow more items to be equipped on the player, such as backpacks, elytras, and
totems.


**__Plushies__**

The {blue}Shepherd Villager{} (the one with the {red}Loom{}) will trade mob plushies when at *naster level*.

;;;;;

**__Capes__**

Players now can use any cape that they'd like.


Press <keybind;Show Cape Selection Screen> to open the capes menu and 
pick one out, or upload a custom one.
