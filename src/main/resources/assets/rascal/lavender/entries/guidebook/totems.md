Beyond the regular {blue}Totem of Undying{}, there are a few more to know about. All Totems can be equipped in the *Totem
Trinket slot.*


**__Totem of Freezing__**

When the user takes damage while under half health, the {blue}Totem of Unfreezing{} will freeze all entities in a close

**[Iceologer](^rascal:friends_and_foes)**.


**__Totem of Illusion__**

Dropped by the **[Illusioner](^rascal:friends_and_foes)**, the {blue}Totem of Illusion{} activates when the user takes
