Some mobs - namely zombies, skeletons, creepers, and witches - have heightened senses. They will react to sound 
that players make and search for them. Additionally, when a player is damaged, blood will spill on the floor and allow
these mobs to track them down.


They will also react to {yellow}light sources{} from a distance.
