A world map is at your fingertips at all times, called the **Antique Atlas**. Press <keybind;key.antique_atlas.open>
to view it. Here you can see nearby geographical features, **[Waystones](^rascal:waystones)**, and more.


The map is kept minimal to encourage players to still use the physical world for most navigation purposes.

Take in the beautiful scenery instead of being distracted by a minimap!
