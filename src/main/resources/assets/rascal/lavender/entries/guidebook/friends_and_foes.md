Through **[Friends & Foes](https://modrinth.com/mod/friends-and-foes)**, all the mobs which failed the mob votes have
been brought to life! This entry briefly logs each of them.


**__Rascal__**

Obviously the best mob in the game... The **{red}Rascal{}** is a mischievous creature commonly found in Mineshafts, and 
loves playing hide and seek. Play and find him 3 times, and he'll

;;;;;

reward you with something he scavenged from the caves!


**__Copper Golem__**

Loves to press {blue}Copper Buttons{} and like other copper-based objects, is subject to oxidation. The **Copper Golem**
can be built by placing a {blue}Copper Block{}, {blue}Jack-O-Lantern{}, and {blue}Lightning Rod{} (from bottom to top).
They can also be healed by using a {blue}Copper Ingot{} on them.

;;;;;

**__Tuff Golem__**

Statue-like, the **Tuff Golem** displays any item which it is given. Although, it sometimes likes wandering around,
unless stuck in place by a {blue}Honeycomb{}.


**__Iceologer__**

The **Iceologer** is an Illager from the tundra who is skilled in both summoner magic and archery. They are light on 
their feet and will try getting a tactical advantage on the player. They will also join nearby 

;;;;;

village raids to aid with the assault. Drops the **[Totem of Freezing](^rascal:totems)** and lives in their *Iceologer 
Cabin.*


**__Illusioner__**

Another Illager skilled in magic, the **Illusioner** is capable of *duplication casting*. They are extremely
dangerous to unsuspecting victims and are often recruited into ongoing raids. Drops the
**[Totem of Freezing](^rascal:totems)** and lives in their *Illusioner Shack.*

;;;;;

**__Glare__**

Naturally found wandering Lush Caves, the **Glare** is a mob which snacks on {blue}Glow Berries{}, which can be used to
tame or breed them. When tamed, they will seek out dark places and become audibly grumpy, alerting its owner if an area
is dark enough for mobs to spawn.


**__Moobloom__**

Exploring the Flower Forests, the **Moobloom** leaves a trail of flowers in their path and has {blue}Buttercups{}
blooming on

;;;;;

their backs. These small yellow flowers can be sheared off, turning the Moobloom back into a regular cow.


**__Crab__**

Friendly creatures which crawl among Beaches and Mangrove Swamps. The **Crab** is bred with {blue}Kelp{} and buries
their eggs in {blue}Sand{} or {blue}Mud{}. It also drops the {blue}Crab Claw{} and is used to brew a potion which
increases a player's reach.

;;;;;

**__Mauler__**

Also known as The Great Hunger, the **Mauler** is a surface-dweller which hunts small animals. They are perpetually
hungry, and can be used to store XP by feeding it enchanted items or books. As they grow larger the more XP they 
consume, the points can be retrieved by using an empty {blue}Bottle{} on it.

;;;;;

**__Wildfire__**

The king of the *Citadel* in the Nether, the **Wildfire** is a very powerful Blaze which protects itself with shields.
When killed, it drops {blue}Wildfire Crown Fragments{} which can be used to craft the {blue}Wildfire Crown{}, granting
permanent *Fire Resistance.*
