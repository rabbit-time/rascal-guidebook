Hate when creepers grief your builds? Don't worry, explosions caused by mobs will heal back
over time! That includes creepers, ghasts, and withers.


Although, those explosions will no longer drop blocks to prevent duplication. Careful if they
destroy your chests, those items will still drop onto the ground and can despawn.
