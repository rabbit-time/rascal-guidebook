**Tree harvesting** allows players to quickly chop down trees, but it requires an axe.


To harvest a tree, sneak and break the bottom block (<keybind;key.sneak>+<keybind;key.attack>) to break down the entire
tree. Leaves will also decay much faster, making cleanup very easy.

Depending on how large the tree is, it will take longer to chop and will apply the correct amount of damage to the axe.
