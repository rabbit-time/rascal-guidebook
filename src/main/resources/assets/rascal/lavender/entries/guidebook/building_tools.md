**__Hammer__**

Many of the blocks from {red}Handcrafted{}, namely trims and cupboards, can have their style 
changed by using a hammer:

<recipe;handcrafted:hammer>

;;;;;

Use <keybind;key.use> to use the hammer on a block. For some blocks, such as trims, the style also changes 
based on whether you're sneaking or not.

**__Trowel__**

The trowel is a great tool for builders. When using it to place blocks, it will shuffle all the blocks in the player's
hotbar.

<recipe;trowel:trowel>

Try using <keybind;key.use> while holding the trowel out with some blocks in your hotbar.
