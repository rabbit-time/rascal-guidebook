To prevent item despawn, a {blue}Gravestone{} is placed when a player dies and holds their items 
along with some of their XP points.


A player may run back to their gravestone and collect their items. However, if they die 
again after that, their gravestone will enter stages of decay and lose XP with each stage.
Dying too many times will break the

gravestone and spill its contents onto the ground, where item despawn will take place shortly after.


{blue}Gravestones{} can also be crafted for aesthetic purposes, or perhaps to honor a fallen pet.
