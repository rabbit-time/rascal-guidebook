more about the different parts of the camera.  


The camera can accept different film rolls and attachments to augment it, such as a Spyglass for zoom or a Redstone Lamp
for flash.


When ready, press <keybind;key.use> to look through the viewfinder and take the first photo using 
<keybind;key.attack>. In the viewfinder, you can also press <keybind;key.sneak> to change camera settings.

film rolls, or experimenting with the camera's settings.
